<b><font size=10>About this software</font></b>

It is a linux graphical software written to ease those dull and repetitive
tasks in converting and processing images,text,video files,music files etc.

The files conversion and processing was not written from scratch and built 
into the sofware.The software just try run those well tried and battled 
commands from complex programs like ImageMagick,netpnm,Ghostscript and 
enscript and do it job.This software is just a mockup of a graphical 
interface to host external program's commands.
