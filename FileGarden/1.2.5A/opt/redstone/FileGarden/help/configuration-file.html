<b><font size=10>The configuration file</font></b>

The conversion and processing commands are not built into the program,
you will be the one who add in the commands to suit your needs through a 
configuration file.A graphical configuration frame will be plug-in in the
future.Right now the programs only comes with those commands for enscript
,ImageMagick,netpnm and enscript.
Since version 1.2.2B,a front-end for page formating with enscript with 
page preview had been added,plus a first time installation gui for the 
program.You can go to 
http://web.singnet.com.sg/~alred/filegarden-screen-shots.html and view
some of the actions which can be done by the software.
 
If you would like to add in new functions to perform a certain task
please email me or sent in a request from the project page.Let me know
which program's command you would like to use and I will sent you the
configuration file to run it.
If you had done something queaky or fantastic and with sucess,please sent
me your configuration file.I will post it on the project page for everybody
to use.
